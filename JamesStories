* Consider making ScannerFragmentBase a native Fragment (as opposed to support.v4 Fragment). Glass isnâ€™t supporting older versions, and including the support libraries adds unneeded bloat to the file.

* Is there supposed to be a onBarcodeScanError() method signature in the OnScannerResultListener? Does the SDK determine scan errors, or do we?
