Switch to TextureViews that will give app developers more flexibility
Configuration Class change parameters of camera
Use a default layout but allow override via a xml property, gives flexibility and provides a safe default
move boilerplate and allow to connect to voice service from anywhere
Logger should be started from a more generic call. Augmate.start();
ScannerActivity should be in sdk, for quick scans
setupScannerActivity in ScannerFragmentBase should have a convenience method without the debugger
also debugger should probably be build into scanner and more of an option you turn on debugMode()
